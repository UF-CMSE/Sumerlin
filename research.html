		</font><font face="Calibri">Responsive polymeric materials can be 
		prepared by a wide variety of synthetic techniques, though not all of 
		these methods are widely applicable. We seek to develop routes to 
		complex polymers by using only simple and straightforward chemical 
		transformations. For instance, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne coupling and other efficient 
		synthetic strategies (<a href="#Bismaleimide">Diels-Alder reactions, Michael addition</a>, etc.) 
		can be used to prepare, for example, functional telechelics, molecular 
		bottle-brush copolymers, and thermoresponsive hyperbranches. We have 
		developed new azido-functionalized chain transfer agents that allow 
		end-functional polymers to be prepared by reversible 
		addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. In addition 
		to have controlled molecular weights, the resulting polymers contain 
		azido groups capable of quantitatively reacting with small molecule or 
		polymeric alkynes under non-demanding conditions. We also 
		investigate end group transformations that exploit the telechelic sulfur functionality 
		inherent to polymers prepared by RAFT. We have demonstrated that 
		dithioester or trithiocarbonate end groups can be readily reduced to 
		thiols capable of efficiently reacting with electron deficient alkenes 
		to yield a range of materials, including modular block copolymers, 
		functionalized surfaces, or polymer-protein conjugates. Many of the synthetic methods 
		we consider fall 
		within the realm of “click chemistry,” and have proven to be excellent 
		candidates for materials derivatization. </font></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Calibri"><br>

		controlled-architecture, functional polymers is a significant advantage 
		when trying to design new materials for applications in drug delivery, 
		biological imaging, tissue engineering, etc. We explore routes to 
		macromolecules that can be used in such applications because of the 
		ability to self-assemble/dissociate in response to an applied stimulus. 
		For instance, we prepare block copolymers that form micelles or vesicles 
		when triggered by stimuli experienced in biological milieu. In some cases, these nanoassemblies are 
		decorated 
		with biological ligands that facilitate targeted delivery to tumors in 
		order to localize the delivery of anticancer drugs. Systems with 
		potential for delivery of other drugs have also been prepared by 
		appropriately designing new responsive polymeric micelles and vesicles. 
		For example, while the large majority of previous reports of 
		stimuli-responsive block copolymers have involved well-known polymers 
		with susceptibility to changes in temperature, pH, or ionic strength, we 
		have helped expand the repertoire of applicable stimuli by preparing 
		block copolymers that respond to changes in glucose concentration. These 
		novel materials have potential therapeutic utility for the deliver of 
		insulin during the treatment of diabetes.</font></span><font face="Calibri"><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>

		reconstruction in the presence of a competing
